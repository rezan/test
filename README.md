name
        The name of the kvstore instance.
key

EXAMPLE
=======

```vcl

import kvstore;

vcl_init
{
  kvstore.init(0, 25000, false);
}

vcl_recv
{
  //use as a 10 second cache
  set req.http.cachevalue = kvstore.get(0, "somekey", "");
  if(req.http.cachevalue == "")
  {
    set req.http.cachevalue = "somevalue";
    kvstore.set(0, "somekey", req.http.cachevalue, 10);
  }
}


```


INSTALLATION
============

The source tree is based on autotools to configure the building, and
does also have the necessary bits in place to do functional unit tests
using the ``varnishtest`` tool.

Building requires the Varnish header files and uses pkg-config to find
the necessary paths.

Usage::

 ./autogen.sh
 ./configure

If you have installed Varnish to a non-standard directory, call
``autogen.sh`` and ``configure`` with ``PKG_CONFIG_PATH`` pointing to
the appropriate path. For kvstore, when varnishd configure was called
with ``--prefix=$PREFIX``, use

 PKG_CONFIG_PATH=${PREFIX}/lib/pkgconfig
 export PKG_CONFIG_PATH

Make targets:

* make - builds the vmod.
* make install - installs your vmod.
* make check - runs the unit tests in ``src/tests/*.vtc``
* make distcheck - run check and prepare a tarball of the vmod.
